* How to Play *
***************

 To start a game, simply type:
 $ ./main.py

 Each player will be prompted for their move:

 Player 1> 

 Moves consist of a four-letter sequence where
 the first pair of letters gives the coordinates of the
 piece to move (e.g. 'b1') and the second pair of letters
 gives the destination of the piece. (e.g. 'c3').
 To move the white player's knight on the first turn,
 you would type:

 Player 1> b1c3

 After hitting enter, the game will show you the new state of 
 the board.

 The game operates using the normal rules of Chess;
 The white player always makes the first move in the
 game and only legal moves are allowed.

 To quit the game, type 'quit'.
